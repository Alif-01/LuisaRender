High-performance cross-platform Monte-Carlo renderer for stream architectures based
on [LuisaCompute](https://github.com/LuisaGroup/LuisaCompute).

LuisaRender is also the *rendering application* described in the SIGGRAPH Asia 2022 paper
> ***LuisaRender: A High-Performance Rendering Framework with Layered and Unified Interfaces on Stream Architectures***.

See also [LuisaCompute](https://github.com/LuisaGroup/LuisaCompute) for the underlying *framework* as described in the paper; and please visit the [project page](https://luisa-render.com) for other information about the paper and the project.
